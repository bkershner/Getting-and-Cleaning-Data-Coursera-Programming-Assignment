# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Coursera-Programming-Assignment

## Introduction
The contents of this repository represent my submission for the Coursera Peer Graded Assignment: Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project.  It contains R code and documentation of the project.

### Data Source
I obtained the data for this project at this url, [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip] (link provided by Coursera).

### Description
The run_analysis.R script included in this repository performs all of the following analysis:
1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The results of this analysis can be seen in the Kershner_tidy.txt file, also included in this repository.
